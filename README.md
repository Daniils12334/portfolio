# Data Science & Machine Learning Roadmap

This is my personal roadmap for learning Data Science and Machine Learning. I track my progress here, and you can see what I have already learned.

## âœ… Programming & Tools
- [x] Python Basics (syntax, data structures, functions, OOP)
- [x] NumPy (arrays, matrix operations, vectorization)
- [x] Pandas (data manipulation, data cleaning, merging datasets)
- [x] Matplotlib & Seaborn (data visualization)
- [x] Unix/Linux Commands (working with the terminal, scripting)
- [x] Git & GitHub (version control, repositories, commits, branches)
- [x] C++ (reading and understanding code, syntax, data structures, functions, OOP)
- [x] OpenCV (image processing and computer vision basics)

## ðŸ“Š Mathematics & Statistics
- [x] Linear Algebra (vectors, matrices, eigenvalues)
- [x] Probability & Statistics (distributions, hypothesis testing)
- [ ] Calculus (derivatives, gradient descent)
- [ ] Optimization Methods (loss functions, backpropagation)

## ðŸ¤– Machine Learning
- [ ] Scikit-Learn (linear regression, classification, clustering)
- [ ] Feature Engineering (handling missing data, feature scaling)
- [ ] Model Evaluation (cross-validation, confusion matrix, AUC-ROC)
- [ ] Hyperparameter Tuning (GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV)
- [ ] Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)
- [ ] Unsupervised Learning (PCA, K-Means, DBSCAN)

## ðŸ§  Deep Learning
- [ ] TensorFlow / PyTorch (basic neural networks)
- [ ] Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs, image classification)
- [ ] Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs, LSTMs, time series forecasting)
- [ ] Transformers & NLP (tokenization, word embeddings, BERT)

## ðŸ”§ Deployment & Real-World Projects
- [ ] Flask/FastAPI (creating ML APIs)
- [ ] Docker (containerizing ML models)
- [ ] Cloud Services (AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure)
- [ ] Real-World Projects (predictive modeling, data analysis, automation)
